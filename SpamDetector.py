""" â€¨
Spam detector 

Some of the internet spams follow one of these patterns below:

-  A word that has more than 2 capital letters
- A letter in a word is repeated at least three or more times
-  There is no vowel (o-i-e-a-u) in that word
- Characters other than letters are used in the word

Write a program to print the number of spam words in the output by taking a sentence.

Input: Includes a string containing words separated by a space character.

Output: An integer is the number of words that follow the spam pattern.
